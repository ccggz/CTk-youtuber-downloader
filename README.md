# CTk-youtuber-downloader
****Doesn't work with Age-restricted content****

I utilized CustomTkinter to design a user interface, enabling user interaction with the program. The primary objective is to download videos from YouTube using the pytube library and send the downloaded videos directly to a designated download folder. In case the folder doesn't exist, the program takes the initiative to create a folder called "downloader" to accommodate the downloaded videos.
